### PR Description Guidelines

Please ensure the PR description answers the following questions:

1. **What did you do?**
    - Provide a clear, high-level summary of the changes.
    - Avoid listing individual changes unless necessary.
    - Example:
      *Sentry now allows modifying the default breadcrumb message. Implemented feature to recognize clicked elements and human-readable text from available HTML attributes.*

2. **Why did you do it?**
    - Explain the purpose of the changes (technical and/or business reasons).
    - Keep the reasoning focused and clear.
    - Example:
      *Sentry breadcrumbs were not providing enough context to restore user actions, leading to confusion during debugging.*

3. **How did you do it?**
    - Summarize the technical implementation.
    - Focus on significant changes and non-obvious details.
    - Example:
      *Refactored the dropdown component using the Intersection Observer API to dynamically position the dropdown menu.*

**Additional Tips:**
- Include **visual aids** (screenshots, diagrams) when applicable.
- Keep the description **concise** but informative.
