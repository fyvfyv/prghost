### PR Description Guidelines

Please ensure the PR description follows these strict guidelines:

1. **What did you do?** (2-5 sentences)
    - Provide a clear, factual summary of the actual changes made
    - Focus only on what was implemented, not potential benefits
    - Avoid speculation about future improvements
    - Keep this section strictly factual and limited to 2-5 sentences, focusing only on the actual changes made.

    - Example:
      *Added a new breadcrumb customization feature to Sentry that extracts clicked element text from data-* attributes and aria-label. Implemented fallback to element content when attributes are unavailable.*

2. **Why did you do it?** (2-5 sentences)
    - Include only reasons supported by provided context or visible technical needs
    - If no clear business context is provided, focus on technical necessity
    - Avoid assumptions about UX or platform improvements
    - Example:
      *Current breadcrumb implementation was missing critical user interaction details, causing incomplete error context. Internal logging showed 40% of customer issues required additional user steps clarification.*

3. **How did you do it?**
    - List specific technical implementation details from the code changes
    - Focus on architectural decisions and key technical choices
    - Include any important technical constraints or considerations
    - Example:
      *Implemented a new BreadcrumbProcessor class that:
      - Extracts text using a priority-based attribute reader (data-* > aria-label > textContent)
      - Integrates with existing Sentry event pipeline
      - Maintains backward compatibility with existing breadcrumb format*

**Additional Requirements:**
- Keep all sections concise and factual
- Include screenshots or diagrams only if they demonstrate implemented changes
- Preserve any existing template structure and formatting
- If information is missing for any section, keep it minimal rather than making assumptions
